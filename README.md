# GAN Image Inpainting
Using Generative Adversarial Networks implementations to reconstruct corrupted images (Inpainting).

The purpose of this application is to quickly compare different implementations.

This app uses implementations and pre-trained models from:

[Region-wise-Inpainting](https://github.com/vickyFox/Region-wise-Inpainting)

[Generatitve-Inpainting](https://github.com/JiahuiYu/generative_inpainting)

[Pluralistic Image Completation](https://github.com/lyndonzheng/Pluralistic-Inpainting)

More implementations soon.

## Install
Each implementation has pretrained models. You can navigate in model folders to get a readme.txt with the download link.


## Run
```python app.py ```
Open your browser and navigate: http://localhost:90000
