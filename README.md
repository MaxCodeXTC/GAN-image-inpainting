# GAN Image Inpainting
Using Generative Adversarial Networks implementations to reconstruct corrupted images (Inpainting).

The purpose of this application is to quickly compare different implementations.

This app uses implementations and pre-trained models from:

[Region-wise-Inpainting](https://github.com/vickyFox/Region-wise-Inpainting)
[Generatitve-Inpainting](https://github.com/JiahuiYu/generative_inpainting)
[Pluralistic Image Completation](https://github.com/lyndonzheng/Pluralistic-Inpainting)

More implementations soon.
